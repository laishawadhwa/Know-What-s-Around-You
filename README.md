# A Visual Question Answering application using Dense Co- Attention Networks
An implementation of the novel Dense Co-Attention Networks for Visual Question Answering with KQV Attention and Multi-Modal Feature Fusion techniques.

Implementation of the paper [Improved Fusion of Visual and Language Representations by Dense Symmetric Co-Attention for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00775)

The model can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u4r-gMIXHUFQ4-iduNzFw5nm2aT43jDi/view?usp=sharing).
The report for the project can be found in the repo.
