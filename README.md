# A Visual Question Answering application using Dense Co- Attention Networks
Teh applicationn is an implementation of the paper [Improved Fusion of Visual and Language Representations by Dense Symmetric Co-Attention for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00775).

The Visual question answering application uses Dense Co-Attention Networks with KQV Attention and Multi-Modal Feature Fusion techniques which add novelty to the solution.

Data Set used: MSCOCO dataset available publicly at VQA official [website](http://www.visualqa.org).
